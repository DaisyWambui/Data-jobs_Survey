# Data-jobs_Survey
This data cleaning analysis focuses on preparing the 'tech_jobs' dataset for further analysis by performing various cleaning and transformation steps.
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves identifying and rectifying issues, errors, and inconsistencies in datasets. It plays a vital role in ensuring data quality, reliability, and accuracy, enabling meaningful analysis and insights. This documentation outlines the data cleaning process applied to the 'tech_jobs' dataset, highlighting the various steps undertaken to clean and transform the data for analysis.

The 'tech_jobs' dataset contains information related to job roles, salaries, industries, programming languages, and desired job factors. However, before conducting any meaningful analysis on this dataset, it was necessary to perform data cleaning tasks to address issues such as irrelevant columns, inconsistent data formats, and unstandardized information.

The data cleaning analysis consists of several key steps. Firstly, irrelevant columns that do not contribute to the analysis were dropped, streamlining the dataset. Next, the 'Q3 - Current Yearly Salary (in USD)' column was split into two separate columns, allowing for calculations and analysis of salary averages.

Furthermore, long column names were renamed to shorter, more concise names, enhancing readability and ease of reference during analysis. Job titles, industries, and programming languages were mapped to standardized titles based on specific keywords, enabling better categorization and comparison across similar entities.

Additionally, desired job factors were consolidated to identify common themes and priorities among respondents. Lastly, countries mentioned in the dataset were consolidated into continents to provide a broader geographical perspective during analysis.

By documenting the data cleaning process, we aim to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the steps taken to clean the data and lays the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights derived from the 'tech_jobs' dataset.
